description: A guide to configuring connection pooling in Flask for better performance.
---

Hey there! In this guide, we will discuss how to configure connection pooling in Flask. Connection pooling is a technique that can significantly improve the performance of your Flask application by reusing existing database connections, instead of creating a new connection every time an application needs to talk to the database.

## Introduction

In this guide, we will discuss how to configure connection pooling in Flask. Connection pooling is a technique that can significantly improve the performance of your Flask application by reusing existing database connections, instead of creating a new connection every time an application needs to talk to the database.

## What is Connection Pooling?

Connection pooling is a method used to minimize the cost of opening and closing connections to the database. It involves keeping a cache of database connections that can be reused when future requests to the database are required.

## Why Use Connection Pooling?

Using connection pooling can greatly improve the performance of your Flask application. It reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection every time an application needs to talk to the database, which can be a time-consuming process.

## Configuring Connection Pooling in Flask

Flask uses SQLAlchemy as its ORM, and SQLAlchemy supports connection pooling out of the box. Here's how you can configure it:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE'] = 20
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_MAX_OVERFLOW'] = 0

db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we discussed how to configure connection pooling in Flask. Connection pooling is a powerful technique that can greatly improve the performance of your Flask application by reusing existing database connections. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can configure connection pooling in your Flask application and enjoy the benefits of improved performance.
